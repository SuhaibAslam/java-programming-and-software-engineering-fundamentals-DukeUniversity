# A range of coding challenges for the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals specialization from Duke University

This Specialization (consisting of five courses) covered the fundamentals of software development, focusing on an introduction to rigorous problem-solving approaches while still extending traditional methods of computer science and software engineering. Google contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to the specializationâ€™s courses.

The projects ranged from simple scripts to more complicated systems. They also ranged in topics from ciphers and word predictions to movie recommenders, sorters and genetic applications.

*Please note that a lot of the code is a bit rough and needs refactoring, proper structuring and further documentation. Nonetheless, it shows significant coding competencies.*
